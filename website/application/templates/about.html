            This website is a prototype of Chatmeleon, which is a proposed mobile chatting application
            that changes colors based on the current mood of the ongoing conversation using a smart algorithm.
            It also has a 'Suppressor' feature that uses another algorithm in order to determine whether or not
            a sent message is deemed inappropriate.

           This is in order to enhance the user experience of online messaging by using adaptive colors that
           accentuate positive emotions, and at the same time, diminish feelings of negativity.
           The 'Suppressor' feature also prevents harmful messages from ever entering the chat
           which facilitates a civil and friendly conversation.
